  - title: 'Canadian Charms'
    text: |
      Here industry is not in vain,
      For we have bounteous crops of grain,
      And you behold on every field
      of grass and roots abundant yield,
      But after all the greatest charm
      Is the sung home upon the farm,
      Ans store walls now keep cattle warm.
